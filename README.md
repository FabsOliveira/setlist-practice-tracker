# setlist-practice-tracker
Webapp to keep track of my piano practice.

Click the practice button again on the same day to undo marking a song as practised.
Use the delete button (üóëÔ∏è) to remove a song from the list.

## Running the project
Open `index.html` in your browser. The app stores song data in `localStorage`.

If you want to persist your songs beyond the browser and share them across devices,
run the small server included in this repository. First install the dependencies
with `npm install`, then start the server with `npm start` (or `node server.js`).
The server saves your song data to `songs.json`.

## Import/Export
Use the **Import Songs** button to load a JSON file containing your songs.
Use **Export Songs** to download the current list for backup. A small sync
indicator next to the buttons shows whether your page data matches the last
imported or exported file.
